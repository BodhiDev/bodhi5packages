midori (0.5.11-ds1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bumping Standards-Version to 3.9.8; removing midori-dbg package.
    Our Standards-Version was out-of-date, so now we're using 3.9.8, the
    latest one.  Also, there is no need to build midori-dbg anymore,
    because Debian now builds dbgsym packages by default.

midori (0.5.11-ds1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rename package (and source tarball) in order to fix a mistake that
    happened when uploading the first version of the "0.5.11" version.
    Somehow, the source tarball was different than the original tarball.
    Fortunately, the only difference were the timestamps.
  * Update version of Chromium's User-Agent string.
    We identify ourselves as Chromium to other websites, but the version
    we use in the User-Agent string is pretty old.  This commit updates it
    to a newer version (49.0.2571.2, from Nov 22 2015).  The positive
    side-effect from doing this is that Google does not bother the user
    asking her to upgrade to a "newer Chrome". (Closes: #805457)
  * Convert patch add-debian-searches to gbp-pq.
    Trivial adjustment on add-debian-searches in order to make it
    compliant with gbp-pq.
  * Better handling of self-signed certificates.
    Midori needs gcr/gnome-keyring in order to fully work with self-signed
    TLS certificates.  This commit improves the error message that is
    displayed when clicking on "Trust this website" does not work, and
    also makes the Debian Midori package recommend installing
    gnome-keyring.  This is the best we can do for now. (Closes: #799963)
  * Improve security by making sure that we use a safe set of ciphers.
    This comes from Debian bug #804196 (LP Bug #1517265).  When Midori
    uses libwebkitgtk, it inherits the default value of the
    G_TLS_GNUTLS_PRIORITY environment variable.  Unfortunately this value
    is not safe enough because it still lets GnuTLS to enable to unsafe
    ciphers.  Therefore, we need to set this variable ourselves and make
    sure that Midori is using safe ciphers for TLS operations. (Closes: #804196)
  * Override "source-is-missing data/autosuggestcontrol.js"
    Lintian is wrongly reporting a "source-is-missing" error for
    data/autosuggestcontrol.js.  I have reported a bug against it (809170)
    and now I am overriding the error.
  * Fix Vcs-* URLs.
    The package was still using old, non-canonical URLs for
    Vcs-{Git,Browser}.  Update them now.
  * Remove midori.menu (and solve lintian warning)
    Lintian was warning "command-in-menu-file-and-desktop-file".  Since
    Midori already ships a .desktop file, it is time to remove the
    midori.menu file from the package.

midori (0.5.11-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove "Force SSL verification" patch.
    The patch "force-ssl-cert-verification.patch" was mistakenly included
    in the last Midori release; this cased a regression because the user
    cannot access a website that has a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate
    anymore.  This change removes the patch and allows the user to trust
    self-signed certificates again. (Closes: #799337)

midori (0.5.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Yves-Alexis Perez ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Apply patch from Colin Watson to improve conffile handling, using new
    debhelper features.                                         closes: #659773
  * debian/control:
    - update standards version to 3.9.3.
    - update homepage address.
    - remove myself from uploaders.
  * debian/midori.maintscript:
    - handle the /etc/xdg/midori/extensions/libadblock.so removal there.
                                                                closes: #660303
  * debian/patches:
    - force-ssl-cert-verification added, set ssl-strict to TRUE so connections
      are not done if the ssl certificate can't be trusted.
  * debian/compat bumped to 9.

  [ Ryan Niebur ]
  * new upstream version, including the waf unpack changes made thanks
    to the NMU by Koichi Akabe
    - refreshed patches
    - add new Build-Dep on libzeitgeist-dev
  * Improve dh_auto_clean target in d/rules to handle some leftover
    files from quilt and waf

  [ Andres Salomon ]
  * Import Debian patch 0.4.3+dfsg-0.2

  [ Sergio Durigan Junior ]
  * Changing gbp.conf to not override the default tag name for releases.
  * Updating section names on debian/gbp.conf
  * Imported Upstream version 0.5.11
  * Update debian/patches for the new Midori version (0.5.11).
  * Revamp build system (use cmake instead of waf)
    - Update debian/rules, removing old stuff (from waf) and adding new,
      simpler rules for the cmake-based build.
    - Update debian/control, listing the new package maintainer and
      reviewed dependencies.
    - Delete debian/waf-unpack file.
    - Rename debian/config/{Debian,Ubuntu}.h files to
      debian/config/{Debian,Ubuntu}.conf.
    With this change, it is now unnecessary to create a DFSG-modified
    version of the package, because Waf is not used as the build system
    anymore (for more details, see Bug 645191).
    It is possible to build the package now, but it still has some lintian
    warnings that will be fixed in the following changes.
    (Closes: #663185, #758103, #787878)
  * Adding shlibs and lintian-overrides files.
    Due to the way libraries (i.e., plugins) are built by Midori (without
    a proper SONAME), it is necessary (or at least recommended) to provide
    a shlibs file that contains trustworthy information about the
    libraries being installed on the system.
    Unfortunately, it is also necessary to provide a lintian-overrides
    file in order to silence some lintian warnings (mostly about the
    shlibs mentioned above).  We'll have to work with upstream in order to
    solve this problem.
    Another lintian error that needed to be silenced was related to the
    data/midori.swf file, present at the original tarball.  This file is
    used just for testing (i.e., it is not installed in the system), and
    is actually generated using the png2swf utility (from the swftools
    package), which means it can be verified.
  * Rewrite manpage.
    The old manpage was too simple and did not cover many of the options
    supported by Midori on the command line.  Fixed that by rewriting it
    almost completely, including many missing options, updating dates and
    author, and improving the formatting.

    20 conkeror, 30 chimera2, 50 dillo, 50 midori, 69 xlinks2,
    70 iceweasel, 70 kazehakase, 85 epiphany-gecko, 100 konqueror,
    100 netsurf, 120 galeon

midori (0.1.4-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Always use -fPIC. (Closes: #518281).
  * Force rebuild with newer dependencies, to see what happens.
    The next upstream release will require these version bumps anyway.

    * Bump libsoup dependency to 2.25.2.
    * Bump webkit dependency to 1.1 (Closes: #519854, #519123).
    * Bump libunique dependency to 1.0.6 (Closes: #509801).
      Note that 1.0.2 should work: only 1.0.4 is bad.

  * Reintroduce quilt while we wait for the 3.0 source format.
    * Add a Debian search to the default search list (Closes: #520381).
    * Make the homepage a local file.  See patch header for rationale.

  * Use new dh 7.2 "overrides" style.
  * Update copyright file.
  * Remove stale CDBS dependency.
  * Bump standards version to 3.8.1.  No changes necessary.

midori (0.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Use dh(1).
  * New dependency (libidn11-dev) and undependency (libhildon-1-dev).
  * Install /etc/xdg/midori/search.

 -- Trent W. Buck <trentbuck@gmail.com>  Mon, 09 Mar 2009 22:29:12 +1100

midori (0.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Trent W. Buck ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #512788).
    Paraphrasing upstream's blog post:

    * Support for bookmarklets (javascript in bookmarks).
    * Links with target=_blank now work (opening a new tab).
    * With recent versions of libsoup and webkit, cookies can persist
      between sessions.
    * Preferences or bookmarks are saved to disk as they are changed.
    * The first time Midori is run after a crash, it will first
      display a "rescue" dialog allowing preferences to be edited or
      scripts disabled.  This is intended for when a script causes
      Midori to crash as it boots, which would otherwise require
      editing config files by hand to fix.
     * Significant speed and capacity improvements to browsing history.
  * Appease lintian regarding various warnings.
  * Update feature list in Description.
  * Make me the Maintainer and William and Uploader.
  * Rewrite manpage.

  [ William Pitcock ]
  * Fix lintian source warnings concerning midori-dbg.
  * Update my e-mail address.

midori (0.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  From upstream's blog post:

    * Integration of history completion in the location entry.
    * libSoup is used in place of GIO for loading icons, viewing
      sources, saving files, and for the first time icons are actually
      cached on disk.
    * The side panel gained a compact mode to take up considerably
      less space. Bookmarks in the toolbar finally match the menu and
      the panel at any time.
    * The Web Inspector [in] WebKitGtk is now supported.
    * The beginning of unit testing.
    * The ground work for an extension interface has been done,
      extension modules can be written in C at the moment. Bindings to
      Lua and/ or Python are planned for the future. Note that the
      side panel doesn't currently expose the extension management,
      but the Page holder was actually rewritten as one of the example
      extensions.

  * Change build dependency to libsoup (from gvfs and gtksourceview).
  * Rewrite manpage and package description.

midori (0.0.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #497647).
    * control: add new upstream dependencies.
  * control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.0 (no changes).  We were
    actually already using the Homepage header field.
  * control, compat, rules: bump debhelper to 7, because I'm a bit
    paranoid about claiming to build with dh4.1.  Fix dh_strip args in
    rules file since the semantics changed in dh5.
  * README.Debian: discuss "missing" icons.
  * control: recommend gnome-icon-theme (Closes: #494061).
  * control: fix homepage link (Closes: #492687).
  * control: provide www-browser (Closes: #476178).
    Not adding www-browser alternative since other X-based browsers seem
    to only set the x-www-browser alternative.
  * watch: fixed.  Upstream tarballs now hosted by XFCE, yay!
  * presubj, install: have users try GtkLauncher before reporting bugs.
  * midori.menu: add (Closes: #466588).
  * midori.install: install .mo and .png files!
  * control: allow DM uploads, since I'll soon be a DM.
